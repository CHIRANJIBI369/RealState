# 🏡 RealState Project

This project is a hands-on implementation of a real estate data analysis workflow inspired by the [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) YouTube tutorial series. It uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to explore, visualize, and model real estate data.

## 📦 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand data preprocessing techniques
- Apply machine learning models for prediction
- Practice working with Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub
- Learn from and extend a publicly available tutorial
